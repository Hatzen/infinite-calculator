# Infinite-Calculator
Simple implementation of a calculator which can add, subtract, multiply and divide without a limitation of digits.
As a use case we can calculate pi to whatever digit we want. The implementations relies on strings and simple math algorithms, which probably leads to poor performance.  
The code is for educational purpose only.
